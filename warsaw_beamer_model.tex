% Structuring a talk is a difficult task and the following structure
% may not be suitable. Here are some rules that apply for this
% solution:

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.

% - A conference audience is likely to know very little of what you
%   are going to talk about. So *simplify*!
% - In a 20min talk, getting the main ideas across is hard
%   enough. Leave out details, even if it means being less precise than
%   you think necessary.
% - If you omit details that are vital to the proof/implementation,
%   just say so once. Everybody will be happy with that.

\section{Motivation}

\subsection{The Basic Problem That We Studied}

\begin{frame}{Make Titles Informative. Use Uppercase Letters.}{Subtitles are optional.}
  % - A title should summarize the slide in an understandable fashion
  %   for anyone how does not follow everything on the slide itself.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Use \texttt{itemize} a lot.
  \item
    Use very short sentences or short phrases.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Make Titles Informative.}

  You can create overlays\dots
  \begin{itemize}
  \item using the \texttt{pause} command:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      First item.
      \pause
    \item
      Second item.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    using overlay specifications:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item<3->
      First item.
    \item<4->
      Second item.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    using the general \texttt{uncover} command:
    \begin{itemize}
      \uncover<5->{\item
        First item.}
      \uncover<6->{\item
        Second item.}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\subsection{Previous Work}

\begin{frame}{Make Titles Informative.}
通常用分度圆\emph{circle}上的螺旋角$\beta$进行\underline{几何尺寸}的计算\cite{wang}，一般有$\beta=8 \sim 20^{\circ}$，尺寸计算如表\ref{tab1}\\
\begin{table}[!hbp]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{c|c}
	\hline
	名称 & 公式\\
	\hline
	分度圆直径 & $d=m_n\times z/\cos \beta$\\
	齿顶圆直径 & $d_a=m_n\times (z/\cos \beta+2)$\\
	齿根圆直径 & $d_f=d_a-4.5\times m_n$\\
	\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{齿轮参数的计算}
\label{tab1}
\end{table}
利用单圆弧绘法，即三点圆弧近似的方法计算齿轮参数\\

\end{figure}
在图\ref{fig1}中以齿轮轴孔为中心建立坐标系XOY，设圆周方程为：\\
\begin{equation}
	(x-x_c)^2+(y-y_c)^2=r_c^2
\end{equation}\\
